                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>My Name is <i><b>Isyemi Daniel Aduragemi</b></i>, popular known as donny. I help create a website. I am outgoing, dedicated, and open minded. I get across to people and adjust to changes with ease. I belive a person should work on developing their professional skills amd learning new things all the time. Currently, I am looking for a new career opportunities my current job position cannot provide.</p>
                <h3>Still Have a long way to go</h3>
                <p>I still have a long way to go, But I believe with <b>Time And GOD</b> anything is posible and achieveable. Learning how to create website and coding is a never ending learning, you are going to keep learning forever. Consistency is a great key in accomplishing the goal the career you pursuit and giving up is never and will never be an option.</p>
                <p>This is website is more like portfolio website just have home page, contact page, news page, about page, the login page and the sign-up page</p>
